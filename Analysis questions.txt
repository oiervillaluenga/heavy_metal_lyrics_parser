DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS FOR SONGS: ¿what are the generic attributes of n1 songs per year?

Analisis of n1 songs attributes in a year 
1) TIME Avg duration of n1 songs at n1 --> 
	first_time_as_n1: min(parsing_time) when rank = 1 and previous rank > 1
	last_time_as_n1: max(parsing_time) when rank = 1 and previous rank = 1
2) TIME Avg duration of songs in charts --> max(parsing_time) - entry_date


3) QTY Avg qty of positions climbed of n1 songs from entry to peak (min(parsing_time) when rank = 1 and previous rank > 1 - min(entry date into charts))
4) QTY Avg qty of positions climbed of n1 songs from bottom to peak (max(rank) when parsing_date(max_rank) < parsing_date(rank=1) - 1)
5) QTY Avg qty of positions descended from top to bottom max(rank) when parsing_date(max(rank) > parsing_date(rank=1) 
6) QTY Position at exit max(parsing_date(rank))
